# Amazon-Rust-Project
### The dataset, which comes from the "Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought" feature on the platform, was gathered by crawling the Amazon website. The dataset is a directed graph, with directed edges connecting nodes representing frequent co-purchasing behaviours and nodes representing products sold on Amazon. The dataset is a snapshot of the relationships between co-purchasing that were seen on the Amazon website on March 2, 2003. It offers insightful information on the relationships between various products and reflects trends in consumer preferences and purchase behaviour. Analysing such a network can yield information about product recommendations, market trends, and the overall structure of the Amazon product ecosystem as it existed at that particular point in time.
